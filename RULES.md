# INTRO

A competetive dungeon delving game for 4 players

# ROLES

One player is the NEFARIOUS DUKE and is responsible for creating a twisty
deathtrap for the heroes to explore.

The other players take the roles of HEROES with their own unique classes
and abilities. Their aim is to find the heart of the dungeon and take out
the MASTER OF MADNESS by strength, wit and cunning.

# HEROES' TURN

The heroes act in the order determined by the players at the start of the round. During their turn they can move once and perform one action. The hero may perform these in any order (move, action or action, move).

* resting - buy bonfires??

1. *Move* - The hero may spend their action moving.
1. **

# COMBAT

Combat occurs whenever the combat phase begins with any monsters within attack range of a hero.

1. what order does it go in?
1. ranged weapons?
1. flanking - remove all armour?

In combat the heroes have the option to attack, shuffle, withdraw or use an ability. Whilst engaged in combat, the hero cannot perform any other action and can only leave the tile by using the withdraw action.

1. *Attack* - The hero roles all dice in their dice pool. If any of the dice are a success (a 5 or a 6), they deal the heroe's weapon's damage to the monster. The <DM> subtracts that many points from the monster's health pool. If the monster has armour, the damage is absorbed by that amount to a minimum of zero damage. For instance, if a barbarian attacks a formian queen with 4 armour and does 8 damage with her axe, the formian takes 4 damage (8 - 4). If her damage were 4, the formian would take 0 damage (4 - 4).
1. *Shuffle* - The hero swaps position with another member in the same square.
1. *Withdraw* - The hero escapes combat. They immmediately move one tile away from the monster.
1. *Use an ability* - There are many combat abilities a hero can acquire on an expedition. Some require certain sacrifices to use, others are sinle-use only and others can be used indefinitely.
