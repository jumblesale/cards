# INTRO

A competetive dungeon delving game for 4 players

# ROLES

One player is the NEFARIOUS DUKE and is responsible for creating a twisty
deathtrap for the heroes to explore.

The other players take the roles of HEROES with their own unique classes
and abilities. Their aim is to find the heart of the dungeon and take out
the MASTER OF MADNESS by strength, wit and cunning.

# STARTING THE GAME

The <<GM>> takes three tiles from the tile deck, an entrance tile, and their villain tile. The heroes choose two tiles from the hero tiles deck. The <<GM>> must then make an unbroken route to the villain tile.

* traps
* doors

# TILES

## <<GM>> tiles

* Laboratory - when this tile is revealed, place two weapon modifier cards on the tile. The <<GM>> may draw a creature from the eldritch deck and place it on this tile.
* Armoury - when this tile is revealed, draw two cards from the weapon deck and place it on this tile
* Crypt - Whenever this tile is in play, if a hero dies on this tile, draw one new graveyard. When this tile is revealed, place as many tiles as there are marks from the appropriately levelled undead monster deck.
# Treasury - When this tile is revealed, place three treasure tokens on this tile. This tile is jealously guarded by like a golem or something? Draw tree cards - one is nothing, one is two gold, one is a golem - and place them on the tile?
# Library - When this tile is revealed, take a spell from the heroes' spell deck and place it on this tile.

# HEROES' TURN

The heroes act in the order determined by the players at the start of the round. During their turn they can move once and perform one action. The hero may perform these in any order (move, action or action, move).

* resting - buy bonfires??

1. *Move* - The hero may spend their action moving.
1. **

# COMBAT

Combat starts when the combat phase begins with any heroes in the same space as an enemy.

Each hero places their hero card on the table and the <<GM>> places the cards for any monsters involved in the combat facing the hero cards.

## RANKS

There are two ranks where cards can be placed: front and rear. A card can only be placed in the rear rank if there is a card in front of it. Characters with melee range can only attack characters in the front rank if they are in the front rank. Characters with ranged attacks can target either rank.

## FIGHTING

Combat resolves in turns. First the heroes act. The player with the leader token goes first. Then the <<GM>> acts, playing the cards in whatever order they choose.

### COMBAT ACTIONS

During a turn, a character can perform a number of actions:

1. ATTACK - to attack an enemy in range, the character rolls their dice pool. They deal their weapon's damage for each success - the armour of the character they are attacking. Damage done to a monster reduces any upgrade points by the amount of damage done. If there are no upgrade points on the monster card, the monster is destroyed and placed face-up on the monster discard pile.

1. SHUFFLE - if there are cards in the same position in both the front and rear ranks, a character can spend thier action switching places with that character.

If there are cards in the front rank with no card directly behind them in the rear rank, the character can spend their turn moving to the rear rank behind that card.
